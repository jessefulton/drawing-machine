Source code for a custom drawing machine built as part of the [Mechatronics research group at UCSC](http://danm.ucsc.edu/web/Mechatronics)

Hardware consists of a Make Controller with two stepper motors controlling x/y axes and a linear servo motor controlling the up/down motion of the pen.

Video documentation of the project can be found on my [vimeo page](http://vimeo.com/jessefulton).
